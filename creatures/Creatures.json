    "description": "The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae1. It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon, growing up to a meter in length1. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it1.\n\nMost populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn1. When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance1.\n\nUnlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year with 5-10% returning to the sea to spawn again1.\n\nAtlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures1. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed1",

    "description": "Manatees, also known as sea cows, are large, fully aquatic mammals found along tropical and subtropical Atlantic coasts and associated inland waters12. They are part of the family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus2. There are three accepted living species: the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis)2.\n\nManatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants2. They can weigh as much as 590 kilograms (1,300 lb) and may be up to 4.0 metres (13 ft 1 in) long2. They have a large, egg-shaped head, flippers, and a flat tail3. Their skin is gray and they spend much of their time grazing on vegetation in shallow water4.\n\nManatees move slowly through canals and coastal areas at a rate of about five miles per hour5. However, they can travel at speeds close to 15 miles per hour but only in short bursts5. The main causes of death for manatees are human-related issues, such as habitat destruction and human objects",

    "description": "The Striped Bass, also known as the Atlantic Striped Bass, Striper, Linesider, Rock, or Rockfish, is an anadromous perciform fish of the family Moronidae1. It is primarily found along the Atlantic coast of North America1.\n\nThe Striped Bass has a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail12. The common mature size is 20 to 40 pounds (9–18 kg), with the largest specimen recorded at 124 pounds (56 kg), netted in 189613.\n\nStriped Bass are native to the Atlantic coastline of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana4. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water4. Spawning takes place in fresh water4.\n\nAdult Striped Bass are piscivorous (fish-eating) and eat almost any kind of small fish as well as several invertebrates, particularly crabs and squid4. They have few predators, with the exception of seals and sharks4.\n\nStriped Bass have a fairly long life, up to 30 years4. They have been introduced to the Pacific Coast of North America and into many large reservoir impoundments across the United States by state game and fish commissions for recreational fishing",

    "description": "Staghorn Coral, scientifically known as Acropora muricata, is a branching, stony coral with cylindrical branches1. It resembles the antlers of a male deer and is capable of growing into thickets up to five feet high and more than 30 feet across1. The colors of Staghorn Coral range from dark gray and brown to vibrant pinks, purples, and blues1.\n\nStaghorn Coral can be found in shallow tropical reefs, slopes, and lagoons from Israel and Jordan to the eastern coast of Africa and all the way out to islands in the Pacific, such as Vanuatu and Kiribati1. They prefer water depths between 15 and 100 feet1.\n\nLike other corals in the Acropora genus, Staghorn Corals use tiny, stinging tentacles to snatch and eat small aquatic animals known as zooplankton1. They are also nocturnal predators, waiting until the sun goes down before they unfurl their tentacles and start hunting1.\n\nStaghorn Corals harbor Symbiodiniaceae, a family of algae that creates nutrients for the coral by converting sunlight into energy through photosynthesis1. This symbiotic relationship provides the algae with a place to live and protection from predators1.\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest threats facing Staghorn Corals today. Higher than normal water temperatures cause coral to evict their symbiotic algae, which affects how much energy they can create1. This also turns corals white, a phenomenon commonly known as bleaching1. While the coral remains alive in this ghostly state, bleaching renders it more susceptible to stress and disease",

    "description": "The European Pilchard, also known as Sardina pilchardus, is a species of ray-finned fish that is sometimes referred to as a sardine1. This common species is found in the northeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea at depths of 10–100 m (33–328 ft)1.\n\nThe European Pilchard is a small to medium-sized, somewhat elongated, herring-like fish1. It can reach up to 27.5 cm (10.8 in) in length and mostly feeds on planktonic crustaceans1. This schooling species is a batch spawner where each female lays 50,000–60,000 eggs1.\n\nThe upper parts of the European Pilchard are green or olive, the flanks are golden and the belly is silvery1. It is a migratory, schooling, largely coastal species but sometimes travels as far as 100 km (62 mi) out to sea1.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, the European Pilchard moves offshore in the autumn, preferring the deeper cooler waters and constant salinity out at sea to the variable temperatures and salinities of inshore waters1. Spawning starts to take place in winter, and in early spring, juveniles, larvae, and some adults move towards the coast1.\n\nThe diet of the European Pilchard consists of both zooplankton and phytoplankton1. The zooplankton is largely copepods and their larvae, which make daily vertical migrations to feed near the surface at night",

    "description": "The Polar Bear, scientifically known as Ursus maritimus, is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas1. It is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb)1.\n\nPolar bears are about seven to eight feet long, measured from the nose to the tip of their very short tail2. A large male can weigh more than 1,700 pounds, while a large female is about half that size (up to 1,000 pounds)2.\n\nBeneath their thick fur, polar bears have jet black skin3. Their fur is also translucent, and only appears white because it reflects visible light3. Sunlight can pass through the thick fur, its heat being absorbed by the bear’s black skin4.\n\nPolar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean depending on the ocean for their food and habitat3. They are the only bear species to be considered marine mammals3.\n\nThey are solitary and overwhelmingly carnivorous, feeding especially on the ringed seal but also on the bearded seal and other pinnipeds4. The bear stalks seals resting on the ice, ambushes them near breathing holes, and digs young seals from snow shelters where they are born4.\n\nClimate change remains the greatest threat to the polar bear’s survival3. Higher than normal water temperatures cause coral to evict their symbiotic algae, which affects how much energy they can create3. This also turns corals white, a phenomenon commonly known as bleaching3. While the coral remains alive in this ghostly state, bleaching renders it more susceptible to stress and disease",
